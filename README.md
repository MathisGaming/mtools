# mtools
I am implementing different algorithms, data-structure and solutions to problems I am resolving.

HackerRank and Leetcode are 2 websites I like to spend time on so I decided to implement my work on my github page.

This is a WIP and there is a lot of work still to do.

Goal :
- Custom vector class
- LinkedList and DoublyLinkedList
- Binary Search Tree
- Trie
- Sorting Algorithm
- Searching Algorithm
- Some AI (A*, dijkstra)
...

If you have some ideas of things to implement please let me know!
If you are interested about having me helping you out on some projects feel free to shout me an email !
